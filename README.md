# Database Vendor Bindings for ODIN
This library is a collection of bindings for the commonly used relational SQL database vendors, including MySQL, SQLite, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database and Microsoft SQL.

In addition, there are plans to use the "common" folder for thin wrappers to allow abstraction from these low-level bindings for ease-of-use and ability to transition between vendors more quickly.

There may be options for No-SQL vendors later, such as Cassandra and MongoDB.
